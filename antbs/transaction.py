class Transaction(RedisObject):
    """
    This class represents a "transaction" throughout the app. It is used
    to get and set transaction data to the database. A transaction is comprised
    of one or more builds. Each transaction has its own build directory. This
    allows for greater build concurrency and can be easily scaled as needed.

        Args:
            pkg_objs (List): Names of packages to build (A new `Transaction` will be created).
            tnum (int): Get an existing `Transaction` identified by its `tnum`.

        Attributes:
            tnum (int): This transaction's id.
            build_path (str): Absolute path to this transaction's build directory.
            builds (list): This transaction's builds (list of bnums)
            is_running (bool): Whether or not the transaction is currently running.
            is_completed (bool): Whether or not the transaction is done (regardless of build results)
            building (str): The name of the package currently building.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If both `pkg_objs` and `tnum` are Falsey.
